    "While this isn't a particularly good way of computing $\\pi$ from a numerical\n",
    "standpoint, it provides for an excellent illustration of how Python's integers\n",
    "are more flexible and powerful than those typically found by default in\n",
    "compiled languages like C and Fortran.  The problem is that for\n",
    "this formula to be even remotely accurate, one must evaluate it for fairly\n",
    "large values of $n$, where both the numerator and the denominator will easily\n",
    "overflow the limits of 64-bit integers.  It is only after taking the ratio of\n",
    "these two huge numbers that the value is small (close to $\\pi$).\n",

    "libraries like [GMP](http://gmplib.org)) would be fairly tricky, in Python it's very\n",

    "For this exercise, write a program that implements the above formula.  Note\n",
    "that Python's `math` module already contains $\\pi$ in double precision, so\n",
