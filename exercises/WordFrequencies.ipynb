    "\n",
    "A common task in text processing is to produce a count of word\n",
    "frequencies. While NumPy has a builtin histogram function for doing\n",
    "numerical histograms, it won't work out of the box for counting discrete\n",

    "\n",
    "But the Python language provides very powerful string manipulation\n",

    "    first, see the gzip module.\n",
    "-   Consider 'words' as the result of splitting the input text into\n",
    "    a list, using any form of whitespace as a separator. This is\n",
    "    obviously a very naive definition of 'word', but it shall suffice\n",
    "    for the purposes of this exercise.\n",
    "-   Python strings have a `.split()` method that allows for very\n",
